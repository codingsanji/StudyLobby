## Welcome to the Study Lobby!

For our second-semester coursework, we had to come up with a business idea. After brainstorming with my awesome group, we decided to create an all-in-one Study/Work Support app that enhances productivity and keeps study notes organized. I had the exciting task of bringing the Study Lobby to life, and this repository is the result of that journey! 🎉📚

### Features that make Study Lobby the ultimate study companion:

- **Ambient Videos** – Set the perfect study atmosphere with calming videos that help you focus. 🌿🎥
- **Study Music** – Tune into soothing background music to keep your mind in the zone. 🎶🎧
